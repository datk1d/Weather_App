#### Description

This is a basic weather app. It shows the weather for a user searching a zipcode.


### Wireframes and User Story

![desktop](https://github.com/datk1d/Weather_App/blob/moving/assets/desktop.jpg?raw=true "Desktop WireFrame")

* The user will enter their zipcode and an API request will be made to Openweather.org and data will be returned and displayed.
* After the info is displayed, the user can still input and search different zipcodes.
* Colors change on the temperature text if it is cold or hot.

### Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScripts
* jQuery
* Openweather API

#### Future Improvements

* Implement checks to ensure the value being input is valid. 
* Let the user know if the zipcode they entered returns nothing (an error).
* Add background images to reflect the weather.
* Fix the submit form.
